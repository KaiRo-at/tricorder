This web app shows data from device sensors in the style of a Starfleet
Tricorder with LCARS interface as seen in the popular Star Trek series and
movies.

This app is destined to be listed in the Firefox Marketplace,
but not developed far enough yet.

The main repo is http://git-public.kairo.at/?p=tricorder.git;a=summary but it's
listed on GitHub at https://github.com/KaiRo-at/tricorder for convenience for
potential contributors. See the TODO for tasks that you can help with.

Please don't use GitHub for issue tracking but http://bugzilla.kairo.at/
